README

*These scripts are modified from the Python 2 codebase of the Beta version of the eVOLVER turbidostat (Wong et al., 2018; doi: 10.1038/nbt.4151)
*The modifications here make the temperature a function of growth rate, allowing the eVOLVER turbidostat to be run as a morbidostat for thermotolerance evolution.
*Alternatively, these scripts include an option to make the temperature a function of time
*Additional modifications may be needed to run this modified codebase on more recent versions of the eVOLVER turbidostat.
*These modified beta scripts are posted with permission from the developers of eVOLVER; for current eVOLVER scripts of the commerical product, visit their official GitHub https://github.com/FYNCH-BIO)
